Process to upload local changes to GitHub Remote server:
1. Make changes to your local file 
2. git add/rm <$filename>   --- stage the changes
3. git commit -m"<your update message>"  --- commit the changes with commit messages
4. git push  --- push the changes to the server
5. git status --- check current status of files that are:
	a. unstaged
	b. not commited 

A hash is like an absolute path: it identifies a specific commit. Another way to identify a commit is to use the equivalent of a relative path. The special label HEAD, which we saw in the previous chapter, always refers to the most recent commit. The label HEAD~1 then refers to the commit before it, while HEAD~2 refers to the commit before that, and so on.

Note that the symbol between HEAD and the number is a tilde ~, not a minus sign -, and that there cannot be spaces before or after the tilde.
